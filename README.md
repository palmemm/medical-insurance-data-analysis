This project was completed as part of the Codecademy 'Data and Programming Foundations for AI' skillpath. 
Medical insurance data was provided with an open-ended prompt to analyze the data in whatever way we were drawn to. 
I chose to analyze data first to understand if gender bias existed in medical insurance pricing, then followed two other variables in an attempt to understand what drives insurance prices most.
I found that smoking was the biggest driver of insurance cost differences out of the variables I analyzed.

This project was done before the pandas library was introduced in this course, but I hope to return to it after learning more to continue this analysis to predict insurance cost for an individual given their unique inputs.
